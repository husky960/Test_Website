                    <p>A clinical psychologist is an expert in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders and illnesses. Unlike psychiatrists, clinical psychologists do not have a medical degree and therefore cannot prescribe medication. However, they work closely with psychiatrists and other medical professionals to ensure comprehensive treatment. To become a clinical psychologist, one must complete a psychology degree and then pursue additional training in clinical psychology.</p>

                    <p>A psychotherapist also specializes in treating mental disorders and illnesses using different psychotherapeutic approaches (e.g. behavioural therapy). Unlike psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, psychotherapists do not need to have a degree in medicine or psychology. Instead, they complete specialized training in psychotherapy. However, some psychotherapists have also completed medical school and work as psychiatrists or clinical psychologists.</p>
